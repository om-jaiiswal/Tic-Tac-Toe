# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript offers a simple and interactive experience. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3×3 grid, aiming for three in a row. JavaScript manages the game logic, turn switching, and win detection, while CSS ensures a clean, responsive design. A great project for practicing DOM manipulation! ❌⭕🎮
